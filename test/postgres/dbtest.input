# dbtest (PostgreSQL)

Hey!! This is a comment about the database we are documenting, it should
appear the first one, and should logically wrap to whatever max line width you
specify in syncdbdocs command line.

## syncdbtest

Let's see how this schema is updated


  ### user

  This is the test comment that we are going to use for the user table, we can
  make it simpler, but this is long because we also want to test how good the
  algorithm of word\-wrap works sorting things out; I believe it will work well,
  but we will see.

    - id [uuid]

    - email [varchar]

      - full_name [varchar?]
        This comment will test the case where there is no comment for full_name in the database,
        but there is indeed a comment to be preserved in the text file.

    - does_not_exist [whatever]
      This will get removed when merged!!

      - language [bpchar?]

        This is an old description of language, will get updated...


  ### deleted_table

  whatever

  - old_field [uuid]

    this was an old field

## my_deleted_schema

### user

 - field
