# dbtest (PostgreSQL)

Hey!! This is a comment about the database we are documenting, it should appear
the first one, and should logically wrap to whatever max line width you specify
in syncdbdocs command line.

## syncdbtest

Let's see how this comment about the schema works out

### user

This is the test comment that we are going to use for the user table, we can
make it simpler, but this is long because we also want to test how good the
algorithm of word-wrap works sorting things out; I believe it will work well,
but we will see.
