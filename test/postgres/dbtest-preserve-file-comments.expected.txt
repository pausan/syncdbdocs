# dbtest (PostgreSQL)

Hey!! This is a comment about the database we are documenting, it should appear
the first one, and should logically wrap to whatever max line width you specify
in syncdbdocs command line.

## syncdbtest

Let's see how this schema is updated

### user

This is the test comment that we are going to use for the user table, we can
make it simpler, but this is long because we also want to test how good the
algorithm of word\-wrap works sorting things out; I believe it will work well,
but we will see.

- email [varchar]

  As you have figured out, this is the email address of the user

- full_name [varchar?]

  This comment will test the case where there is no comment for full_name in
  the database, but there is indeed a comment to be preserved in the text file.

- id [uuid]

- language [bpchar?]

  This is an old description of language, will get updated...

- does_not_exist [whatever]

  This will get removed when merged!!
